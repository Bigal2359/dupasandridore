                    <h1>How We Met</h1>
                    <p>Ariel and Alexander met in college at Syracuse University. They were both at an event at an event in Panasci Lounge in the Schine Student Center and Alex was immediately captivated by her. A mutual friend introduced them that evening. Though Alex wanted to say more than hello, they each only said hello. Ariel goes along with this story only because she doesn't really recall enough details to contest it which makes Alex really sad.</p>
                    <p>They both led lives on opposite ends of campus and had little to no personal interactions throughout their time in undergrad, except for one class they had together, a theater course in the African American studies department. Ariel proactively sought out that class as she wanted to broaden her knowledge of plays by African Amercian writers. However, there were many athletes in the course, and most of them didn't take the class very seriously. Alex was an exception. Sadly, Ariel would often be bored or impatient and didn't attend much, though she did ace it. Ha!</p>

                    <h1>How We Re-Met</h1>
                    <p>10 years later, Ariel is living in Brooklyn, New York and Alex would be there a couple years later. Ariel was headed to work one morning on the J train. She was sitting, he was standing and she caught a glimpse of him from across the train and thought he looked familiar. When Ariel realized it was him, she went over and said hi. They spoke for a couple minutes and discovered they lived in the same neighborhood. Ariel's phone was dead so he gave her his card and she told him that she would send him her number once she got to work.</p>
                    <p>Later that day, Alex sent Ariel a message on Twitter and reminded her that she hadn't sent him her number. She texted it to him.</p>
                    <p>Some time later Alex invited Ariel to a Super Bowl party he was hosting. She went (along with several of our mutual friends). When she got there, it was as if Ariel were seeing him for the first time. He'd just gotten a hair cut (Ariel can always tell when they're fresh as that's her thing). He also had a super fly beard. He was a great host and moved about his space with a quiet confidence that she found alluring. He checked in with everyone ensuring everyone was comfortable and having a good time.</p>

                    <h1>How We Got Together</h1>
                    <p>Ariel and Alex got to know each other slowly, casually, sporadically over the next couple months. It just developed. When Alex did ask Ariel out, she wasn't even sure it was a date. What she found appealing about him is he treated her like his equal. Not like some girl he was trying to win. He was rightfully pissed when she showed up to their first date late. It was seriously the train's fault. But from then on, they professed in a way that made her more accountable.</p>
                    <p>Alex was drawn to Ariel's natural beauty, her smile, southern charm, confidence, and sincere kindness. His dream girl, he confessed. Through true courtship and many long carefree and honest conversations, the two became a staple in each other's lives. Among many things, they shared similar familial upbringings, an innate and true love for art, creativity, adventure, and faith in God. Ariel thinks Alex is true gentleman and finds his ability to surprise her completely fascinating as she is very observant and naturally inquisitive. They've spoken every single day since they started dating and Ariel misses him when he goes out for a Target run. She can't believe she agreed to share that as it is embarrassingly true and cheesy.</p>
