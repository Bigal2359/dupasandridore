                    <h1>How We Met</h1>
                    <p>Ariel and Alexander met in college as 18-year-olds at Syracuse University. They were both at an event on campus and Alex was immediately captivated by her. A mutual friend introduced them that evening. Though Alex wanted to say more than hello, they each only said hello. Ariel goes along with this story only because she doesn't really recall enough details to contest it which makes Alex really sad.</p>
                    <p>They both led lives on opposite ends of campus and had little to no personal interactions throughout their time in undergrad, except for one class they had together, a theater course in the African American studies department. Ariel proactively sought out that class as she wanted to broaden her knowledge of plays by African Amercian writers. However, there were many athletes in the course, and stereotypically, most of them didn't take the class very seriously. Alex was an exception. Alex thinks Ariel didn't take the class very seriously since she rarely attended; Ariel contests she read all the plays and showed up when it was important, since the athletes got on her nerves when she was there. Ain't nobody had time for that.</p>

                    <h1>How We <span class="nowrap">Re-Met</span></h1>
                    <p>10 years later, Ariel is living in Brooklyn. She was headed to work one morning on the J train. She was sitting and caught a glimpse of a guy from across the train and thought he looked familiar. When Ariel realized it was Alex, she went over and said hi. They spoke for a couple minutes and discovered they lived in the same neighborhood.</p>
                    <p>Some time later Alex invited Ariel to a Super Bowl party he was hosting. When she got there, it was as if Ariel were seeing him for the first time. He'd just gotten a hair cut (Ariel could tell right away and complimented him—she loves when guys have new haircuts and he looked so good). He also had a super fly beard. He was a great host and moved about his space with a quiet confidence that she found alluring. He checked in with everybody ensuring everyone was comfortable and having a good time; he seemed to be a really genuine person.</p>

                    <h1>How We Got Together</h1>
                    <p>Ariel and Alex got to know each other slowly, casually, sporadically over the next couple months. When Alex did ask Ariel out, she wasn't even sure it was a date. What she found appealing about him was he treated her like his equal—not like some woman he was trying to impress or win—but still made her feel like a woman he respected and whose time he valued. He was rightfully pissed when she showed up to their first date late, though it was seriously the train's fault.</p>
                    <p>Alex was drawn to Ariel's natural beauty, her smile, southern charm, confidence, and sincere kindness. His dream girl, he confessed. Ariel thinks Alex is a true gentleman and finds his ability to surprise her completely fascinating as she is very observant and naturally inquisitive. Through courtship and many long, carefree and honest conversations, the two became a staple in each other's lives. Among many things, they shared similar familial upbringings, an innate and true love for art, creativity, adventure, and faith in God. They've spoken every single day since they started dating and Ariel misses him when he goes out for a Target run. She can't believe she agreed to share that as it is embarrassingly true and cheesy.</p>
