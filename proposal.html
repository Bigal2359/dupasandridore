                    <h1>The Proposal</h1>
                    <p>After dating Ariel for 2 months I told her that I think she would be a good wife and mother. After our Christmas trip to the Cayman Islands a year later, I was ready to ask her to marry me. The trip was incredible and relaxing but beyond that, because we were the only ones that either of us knew for thousands of miles, it felt like what it would be like to spend my life with her.</p>
                    <p>Ariel loves being around water so I knew exactly where I would propose to herâ€”Niagara Falls. She's always to go to Niagara Falls and we were due for a little vaca. She is also the type to question everything so I told NOBODY about my plans, except for the moms of course. You can't just spring that type of news on them. As far as Ariel knew, we were just going to Niagara Falls for a quick getaway for 2.</p>
                    <p>On the morning of August 16, 2015 in Niagara Falls, ON Canada, I woke Ariel up and after an hour or so she finally got out of bed. We went over to the falls to watch the sun rise. While the sun was rising I asked Ariel which of our vacations was her favorite. She promptly answered the Cayman Islands. I took out the engagement ring I asked Ariel to marry me. She said yes and changed her favorite vacation to Niagara Falls.</p>
