                    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                    <h2>We're flying in from out of town. Should we rent a car?</h2>
                    <p>​Downtown New Orleans is a very walkable city, with restaurants, bars and lots of history and culture. The wedding ceremony will be held at The St. Louis Cathedral in the French Quarter which is in the heart of Jackson Square. Many hotels are nearby with lots of activities and shopping in walking distance of each other. The reception will be held at Crystal Palace Ballroom which is about a 15 minute drive from the church. We recommend taking an uber or taxi if you elect to not rent a car as it is a quick trip. However, if you want to explore some of greater New Orleans, feel free to rent a car. Even if just for a day.</p>
                    <h2>Will I have to pay for parking?</h2>
                    <p>​Many local hotels have parking onsite and their garages average $40 per day, depending on the hotel. However, we recommend using public parking lots which are more cost efficient. There are many in the downtown area and average $25 per day or hourly rates. Please note there is no parking at the St. Louis Cathedral. The church is enclosed in Jackson Square, so you'll need to park nearby and walk over. The Crystal Palace Ballroom has lots of parking available and will be free for all guests should you decide to rent a car.</p>
                    <h2>You mentioned that we should book the hotel early. Is this necessary?</h2>
                    <p>​We strongly encourage you to book your hotel as soon as you can. New Orleans is a very popular city and we want to do our best to ensure that you find a room at the most convenient place possible.</p>
                    <h2>Can we bring our kids?</h2>
                    <p>​We love your children. Ariel especially talks about them often and enjoys spending time with them, but our wedding and party is for adults only. We want you to have a good time and be able to dip it and flip it and know that can be challenging with your little love muffins.</p>
                    <h2>Is there a dress code?</h2>
                    <p>​The wedding and reception are both black tie.</p>
                    <h2>Can I bring a date?</h2>
                    <p>​As we both come from large families, our guest list is restricted to invited family and friends only.</p>
                    <h2>Are there any colors guests should avoid wearing?</h2>
                    <p>​Ivory, Gold, Tan, and White. :)</p>
                    <h2>What should/could I do between the ceremony and the reception?</h2>
                    <p>​We will have a wedding party second line shortly following the ceremony. A second line is a mini parade with a live band and will take place from the church and through a couple streets nearby. Feel free to stroll through Jackson Square post-ceremony before the second line parade begins. Ladies, remember to bring a pair of flats. Read more about second lines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_line_(parades)" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                    <h2>What kind of food will be served and what should I do if I have a dietary restriction?</h2>
                    <p>​Our menu will consist of great southern cuisine and will also accommodate vegetarian diets. We will use your invitation card to capture your preferences.</p>
                    <h2>Can I take pictures?</h2>
                    <p>​Our wedding ceremony will be unplugged. Jesus wants our guests to be fully present and respect the sanctity of the space. We also want our photographer to work without restriction to capture memorable photos of our day. Feel free to take personal photos and selfies at the second line parade or wedding reception. Flattering photos, of course. :)</p>
